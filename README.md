# PageRank
Project to implement a simple PageRank Algorithm similar to a search engine.

This is a set of programs that emulate some of the functions of a search engine. This program crawls a web site and pulls a series of pages into a SQL database, recording the links between pages.

The spider.py program crawls a website and retrieves the number of pages you ask and stores them in a SQL database. The program will not re-crawl any pages already in the database. Thus, each page in the database is unique.
